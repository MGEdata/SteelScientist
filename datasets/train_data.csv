Multilayer TWIP/Maraging steel with high strength, high toughness and interfacial shear strength of 564 MPa is obtained by vacuum hot rolling, subsequent cold rolling and aging treatment.

The true stress-strain curves were modeled using Hollomon equation. It was concluded that the coarse and fine grained samples represent a two stage strain hardening behavior and the reason for these observations was discussed. The electrochemical studies using open circuit potential measurement showed that the fine-grained sample has higher values of OCP than the coarse-grained one. In addition, the potentiodynamic polarization curves for these two types of microstructures demonstrated similar trends. It was also observed that grain refinement decreases the corrosion current density and increases the corrosion potential. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis revealed that grain refinement increases the polarization resistance of ferritic stainless steel.

It was concluded that the coarse and fine grained samples represent a two stage strain hardening behavior and the reason for these observations was discussed. The electrochemical studies using open circuit potential measurement showed that the fine-grained sample has higher values of OCP than the coarse-grained one. In addition, the potentiodynamic polarization curves for these two types of microstructures demonstrated similar trends. It was also observed that grain refinement decreases the corrosion current density and increases the corrosion potential. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis revealed that grain refinement increases the polarization resistance of ferritic stainless steel. Finally, it was deduced that the corrosion and passivation behavior of the ferritic stainless steel in the 0.1 M HNO3 solution are improved by refining the grain structure by thermo-mechanical processing.",Tensile data extracted from stress-strain curves of coarse and fine grained ferritic stainless steel.,Coarse Grained,Tensile Strength (MPa),430,MPa,Yield Strength (MPa),224,MPa,Total Elongation (%),68.8,%,0,0,0.04,0.05,0,0,0,0,0,0.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.5,0.13,0,0,0.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"This material was received in the hot rolled condition and the initial microstructure consisted of equiaxed ferrite grains with mean size of 120 μm.

Recent advances in hybrid additive manufacturing (HAM) have provided more geometrical freedom for the manufacturing of parts with desired properties. In this paper, we report manufacturing of a hybrid 420/Corrax stainless steel with a reliable interface that can be applied in the manufacturing of next-generation geometrically complex plastic injection molding dies with enhanced strength and corrosion resistance. AISI 420 martensitic stainless steel is used as a cost-effective substrate, and a maraging stainless steel grade, known as Corrax, is printed on top of it using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). A hybrid heat treatment cycle is applied to improve metallurgical properties and to enhance mechanical compatibility between the martensitic and the maraging stainless steels. Tensile tests coupled with scanning electron microscopy are carried out for analysis of failure, which show the development of shear bands in the microstructure of the 420 stainless steel substrate while a limited amount of deformation occurs in the interface region and Corrax microstructure. Void nucleation, growth, and coalescence are found at the 420/Corrax interface due to mechanical incompatibility and decohesion; however, microstructural instability mainly occurs along the shear bands on the 420 side and leads to fracture, which is quantified using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography. Nanoindentation tests show that the maximum level of hardness occurs at the interface due to the existence of sub-micron grains and the formation of AlN nanoparticles. Also, the formation of beta-NiAl precipitates enhances the Corrax strength after heat treatment. In addition to a high strength, elevated corrosion resistance of the cooling channels is essential to extend the service life of plastic injection molding dies.

The laser beam was rotated 67° between successive layers during the process. The platform temperature was kept at 80 °C during the printing process to reduce the residual stresses at the interface. The commercial heat treatment of 420 steel includes austenitization at 1010–1030 °C followed by tempering at 230–300 °C, while the heat treatment of Corrax includes austenitization at approximately 900 °C followed by aging at 500–550 °C. In this work, we examined combinations of austenitization and aging temperatures and concluded that a hybrid heat treatment cycle in an Argon atmosphere optimizes mechanical properties and compatibility between 420 and Corrax steels. We chose the 420 austenitization temperature and the Corrax aging temperature as described in the following. The hybrid steel was heated at 15 °C/min to the maximum temperature of 1010 °C and then held for 30 min, followed by quenching with high-pressure Argon, to obtain a fully martensitic matrix.

10.1016/j.msea.2021.141783,Reinforced Cu precipitation strengthening by matrix transformation from martensite to austenite in high-strength low-alloy steel,"We demonstrate here that a new type of Cu precipitation was observed in metastable austenite (gamma'). The Cu precipitates had twin boundaries, array of atoms, dislocations with a large lattice misfit (similar to 3.4 %) and close packed plane misfit (similar to 5.4 degrees) with matrix gamma'. This was accomplished by partitioning and tempering heat treatment in a 0.117C-2.88Mn-1.13Ni-0.89Cu steel. Cu precipitation and austenitization occurred together during tempering, and Cu precipitates were nucleated in martensite, which subsequently migrated to austenite during austenitization. In view of the closed crystal relationship of martensite/Cu precipitate and martensite/austenite, crystal relationships between Cu, austenite and martensite were: {111}(Cu)//{111}(gamma')//{011}(alpha), < 011 >(Cu)//< 011 >(gamma)'//< 111 >(alpha). Misfit between one pair close-packed plane (1-11)(Cu) and (1-11)(gamma') was inherent from the misfit between martensite and austenite. Twin boundaries (twin spacing similar to 2.5 nm) were inherent from twin boundary of 9R-Cu in martensite. The matrix transformation from martensite to austenite compressed the Cu precipitates, and contributed to lattice misfit and defects in Cu precipitate.

10.1007/s11661-017-4122-x,Comprehensive Deformation Analysis of a Newly Designed Ni-Free Duplex Stainless Steel with Enhanced Plasticity by Optimizing Austenite Stability,"A new metastable Ni-free duplex stainless steel has been designed with superior plasticity by optimizing austenite stability using thermodynamic calculations of stacking fault energy and with reference to literature findings. Several characterization methods comprising optical microscopy, magnetic phase measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron backscattered diffraction were employed to study the plastic deformation behavior and to identify the operating plasticity mechanisms. The results obtained show that the newly designed duplex alloy exhibits some extraordinary mechanical properties, including an ultimate tensile strength of similar to 900 MPa and elongation to fracture of similar to 94 pct due to the synergistic effects of transformation-induced plasticity and twinning-induced plasticity. The deformation mechanism of austenite is complex and includes deformation banding, strain-induced martensite formation, and deformation-induced twinning, while the ferrite phase mainly deforms by dislocation slip. Texture analysis indicates that the Copper and Rotated Brass textures in austenite (FCC phase) and {001}aOE (c) 110 > texture in ferrite and martensite (BCC phases) are the main active components during tensile deformation. The predominance of these components is logically related to the strain-induced martensite and/or twin formation.",Table II Mechanical Properties of the Newly Designed Duplex Material Compared with Some Advanced High-Strength Steels,20Cr-8.2Mn-0.32N,Ultimate Tensile Strength (YS) (MPa),890,MPa,Yield Strength (YS) (MPa),530,MPa,Elongation (EL) (Pct),94,no mentioned,0,0,0.02,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.02,8.21,0,0,0.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The alloy was prepared using an induction furnace under nitrogen atmosphere, followed by the pressure electroslag remelting process.

10.1016/j.msea.2021.141670,Strength-ductility enhancement in multi-layered sheet with high-entropy alloy and high-Mn twinning-induced plasticity steel,"In this study, a high-entropy-alloy-cored multi-layered sheet (MLS) clad with an austenitic high-Mn twinning-induced-plasticity steel (HEA/high-Mn MLS) is proposed and its room- and cryogenic-temperature tensile behaviors were investigated. The MLS was fabricated using a commercial roll-bonding procedure. Its interface was well bonded without critical defects such as pores or voids. During the MLS fabrication and subsequent annealing, the interdiffusion of alloying elements and interfacial friction resulted in the formation of epsilon-martensite and V-rich carbides in the high-Mn and HEA layers, respectively, as well as grain refinement. Nevertheless, the interface remained strongly bonded after the tensile deformation at room and cryogenic temperatures, thereby providing larger strength and elongation than the values calculated based on the rule of mixtures. The improvement in tensile properties beyond the calculated values was interpreted by the activation of deformation twins, transformation-induced plasticity, and generation of geometrically necessary dislocations in the HEA/high-Mn interfacial region. Deformation twins were populated at both high-Mn and HEA layers at room temperature. However, at cryogenic temperatures, epsilon-martensite and body-centered cubic martensite were additionally formed in the high-Mn and HEA layers. Thus, both strength and ductility were considerably improved. In addition, the consequent good strength-ductility balance was comparable to or better than those of other HEAs or medium-entropy alloys. This indicates that our MLS can be an attractive design strategy to tailor various properties by controlling the thickness fraction of each layer and develop strong alloys for cryogenic applications.",Engineering tensile test data at 25 and -196 degC for the HEA/high-Mn MLS and nonclad HEA and high-Mn steel sheets.,MLS,Tensile Strength (MPa),909,MPa,Yield Strength (MPa),469,MPa,Elongation (%),53.4,%,0,0,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.48,6.73,16.75,59.52,7.58,1.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0," The HEA ingot (8 kg) was rolled at 1100-900 °C to a 12-mm-thick plate after homogenization at 1100 °C for 6 h.

10.1016/j.msea.2019.05.064,Simultaneous enhancement of strength and ductility via nanoscale Cu precipitates and ultrafine filmy retained austenite in a novel quench-partitioned and tempered steel,"A novel Cu-bearing Quench-Partitioned and Tempered (Q&P-T) steel was designed to achieve an excellent strength ductility balance. Tempering after Q&P treatment increased the tensile and yield strength from 1263 and 706 MPa to 1393 and 1003 MPa, and simultaneously improved the uniform and total elongation from 13.2 and 21.1% to 17.0 and 24.0%, respectively. Dilatometric, XRD and APT analyses as well as SEM and TEM observations revealed that the multiphase structure consisting of fresh martensite, tempered martensite and ultrafine filmy retained austenite was formed via Q&P-T process.

The influences of co-precipitates on the elasto-plastic transition and strain compatibility has been investigated based on the micro-mechanical behavior of constituent phases, the evolution of lattice strain and stress components. Compared to the Cu-Free steel, in which single NiAl precipitates form in ferrite, co-precipitation in the Cu-Added steel results in an improved strain compatibility between austenite (gamma) and ferrite (alpha). The lattice strains of both gamma and alpha phases show similar evolutions during the entire strain regime, and a homogeneous elastoplastic deformation occurs together with a continuous yielding and weak transient of strain hardening rate. The improved strain compatibility leads to an alleviation of strain localization in the phase interfaces, so that the overall back stress increases slowly with the tensile strain increasing during the whole plastic deformation process, although the transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) effect of the Cu-Added steel only occurs at low strains (<5%) due to the low mechanical stability of the retained austenite. In contrast, a non-continuous yielding of the constituent phases occurs in the Cu-Free steel leads to strong strain transfer across the alpha/gamma interfaces due to a low deformation compatibility between austenite and ferrite. High internal stress in the phase interfaces results in easy damage-crack formation, but it can be accommodated by the TRIP effect which dominates in large strains, resulting in back stress decreasing and effective stress hardening during the subsequent deformation stage. However, the introduction of hydrogen can aggravate the dislocation accumulation and strain transfer between austenite and ferrite; thus, hydrogen-induced cracks (HICs) are prone to nucleate at the alpha/gamma interfaces while the TRIP effect is not significant, leading to premature failure and significant elongation loss (85.4%) of the Cu-Free steel.

The influences of co-precipitates on the elasto-plastic transition and strain compatibility has been investigated based on the micro-mechanical behavior of constituent phases, the evolution of lattice strain and stress components. Compared to the Cu-Free steel, in which single NiAl precipitates form in ferrite, co-precipitation in the Cu-Added steel results in an improved strain compatibility between austenite (gamma) and ferrite (alpha). The lattice strains of both gamma and alpha phases show similar evolutions during the entire strain regime, and a homogeneous elastoplastic deformation occurs together with a continuous yielding and weak transient of strain hardening rate. The improved strain compatibility leads to an alleviation of strain localization in the phase interfaces, so that the overall back stress increases slowly with the tensile strain increasing during the whole plastic deformation process, although the transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) effect of the Cu-Added steel only occurs at low strains (<5%) due to the low mechanical stability of the retained austenite. In contrast, a non-continuous yielding of the constituent phases occurs in the Cu-Free steel leads to strong strain transfer across the alpha/gamma interfaces due to a low deformation compatibility between austenite and ferrite. High internal stress in the phase interfaces results in easy damage-crack formation, but it can be accommodated by the TRIP effect which dominates in large strains, resulting in back stress decreasing and effective stress hardening during the subsequent deformation stage. However, the introduction of hydrogen can aggravate the dislocation accumulation and strain transfer between austenite and ferrite; thus, hydrogen-induced cracks (HICs) are prone to nucleate at the alpha/gamma interfaces while the TRIP effect is not significant, leading to premature failure and significant elongation loss (85.4%) of the Cu-Free steel. Therefore, the improved strain compatibility of the Cu-Added steel contributes to a better resistance to hydrogen embrittlement, although both medium Mn steels possess similar tensile strength (1 GPa) and elongation (25%) values.","The statistic mechanical properties of the two medium steels before and after tensile deformation, i.e. yield strength, tensile strength and uniform elongation.",Cu-Added,Tensile strength (MPa),982,MPa,Yield strength (MPa),975,MPa,Tensile elongation (%),26.9,%,0,0,0.01,0,0,0,0,0,1.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,2.5,2.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"After homogenization at 1473 K for 60min, hot rolling was conducted in eight passes between 750 and 1050 °C and then air quenching to room temperature.

10.1016/j.msea.2018.09.092,Influence of intermediate rolling on mechanical behavior of modified 9Cr-1Mo steel,"In the present work, effect of normalizing (950-1050 degrees C) and tempering (650-700 degrees C) has been investigated to study the microstructure and mechanical properties of modified 9Cr-1Mo steel (G91) at room temperature (RT) and 650 degrees C. To improve the high temperature mechanical properties, hot rolling has been done at optimized normalizing and tempering conditions. Microstructural observations show that an increase in tempering temperature leads to decrease in mechanical strength both at RT and 650 degrees C due to the growth of M23C6 particles, formation of sub-grain boundaries and recovery. G91 steel rolled at 550 degrees C and tempered at 650 degrees C is found to have best combination of strength and fracture toughness at RT, which may be attributed to large number of small size of precipitates and increase in dislocation density. However, specimen normalized at 1050 degrees C and tempered at 650 degrees C shows more than 70% improvement in tensile strength at 650 degrees C as compared to as-received condition, which shows that G91 steel is more amenable to precipitation hardening. A typical type of tensile fracture with radial cracks and axial splitting is noticed at RT and - 196 degrees C.

The two steels are featured by the existence of different sizes and shapes of retained austenite showing different mechanical stabilities. Compared with the Al-containing steel, the Al-free steel shows significantly improved tensile strength, uniform strain and total elongation, but exhibits much decreased impact toughness. These results demonstrate conflicting effects of strain-induced martensitic transformation of retained austenite on tensile ductility and impact toughness of TRIP steels. It is indicated that a wide distribution of size and shape of retained austenite is favorable for sustained high strain hardening rate and increased uniform tensile strain; however, thin films of retained austenite, which is mechanically more stable, tends to enhance impact toughness.

The microstructure evolution during both deformation by ECAP and subsequent annealing was investigated and correlated with the mechanical properties. The successive grain refinement during ECAP was promoted by two parallel mechanisms, namely dislocation driven grain fragmentation and twin fragmentation, and accounted for the ultra-high strength. In addition, due to the relatively low volume fraction of deformation twins after ECAP at 300 degrees C, further contribution of deformation twinning during room temperature deformation allowed additional work-hardening capacity and elongation. During subsequent recovery annealing the ultra-fine grains and deformation twins were thermally stable, which supported retainment of the high yield strength along with regained uniform elongation.

Strengthening by nano-scale Cu-rich precipitates compensated softening associated with high temperature annealing, and increased the yield strength of tempered medium-Mn steel by 75 MPa. In addition to facilitating Cu precipitation, the introduction of secondary martensite also promoted nucleation of reverted austenite during tempering with sufficient C and Mn concentration that stabilized austenite and further improved ductility.

10.1016/j.msea.2021.142314,The effect of cold-rolling prior to the inter-critical heat treatment on microstructure and mechanical properties of 4340 steel with ferrite - Martensite microstructure,"This study investigates the effect of cold rolling prior to inter-critical annealing on microstructure and mechanical properties of ferrite-martensite dual phase steel. Samples were heated to 850 degrees C for 1 h followed by oil quenching, then the steel sheet were cold rolled by 0%,10%,15% and 20% reduction in thickness. The intercritical annealing treatment (750 degrees C, 120min) was performed to generate a ferrite-martensite microstructure. Microstructural studies showed that increasing the applied cold rolling, leading to increase in volume fraction of martensite and decrease in ferrite grain size. Mechanical properties of dual phase steel were measured by tensile, impact and hardness tests. Results showed that ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, micro-hardness and toughness (e.g. total elongation, uniform elongation and impact energy) increased with increasing the applied cold rolling. Improvement of mechanical properties were related to increase in martensite volume fraction and ferrite grain refinement. Analysis of strain hardening behavior of DP steels, by Hollomon analysis, showed two stages of strain hardening corresponding to ferrite deformation and co-deformation of ferrite and martensite, respectively. The strain hardening exponent of first stage (n(I)) increased with increasing volume fraction of martensite. The energy absorption capacity (UE x UTS) increased with increasing cold rolling deformation.",Summary of mechanical properties of studied DP steels.,20DP,Ultimate Tensile Strength (MPa),1691.9,MPa,Yield Strength (MPa),1171.8,MPa,Total elongation (%),8.8,%,0,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0.086,0.3,0,0,0,0,0.11,0,1.15,0.77,0,0,0.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"To perform the thermomechanical treatment, samples were cut into 10*50*100 mm plates.

The present work aims to elucidate the effects of quenching temperature on phase transformation kinetics, microstructure evolutions and mechanical properties of a hot-galvanized Q&P steel (0.225C-0.85Si-2.02Mn-0.91Al, in wt.%) by combining modeling and experimental research. Using dilatometry, SEM, EBSD, EPMA, TEM, PED, XRD and Image-Pro Plus (IPP) software, we quantitatively investigated the microstructure evolution at different quenching temperatures. Results indicated that a larger fraction of primary martensite at lower quenching temperature could strongly promote subsequent bainite transformation kinetics, which is attributed to more martensite-austenite interfaces and defect density. By fitting the dilatometer curves and establishing the equation of transformation rate vs. quenching temperature, a Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avram (KJMA) equation was established to describe insufficient bainite formation kinetics during high-temperature short-time overaging. Furthermore, a modified CCE model taking into account intercritical ferrite and short-time bainite transformation was proposed and the predicted RA fractions are more consistent with the experimental values. As the quenching temperature decreases, small-sized blocky RA along martensite boundaries and filmy RA between martensite laths increase, while coarse lath/blocky RA inside bainite structures or at bainite boundaries decreases gradually. In addition, the YS decreases from 763 MPa to 431 MPa with the increase of quenching temperature, while the UTS varies in a narrow range between 967 MPa and 1036 MPa.

This work reports the formation of nano/ultrafine grain structure in the AISI 201L stainless steel using advanced thermo-mechanical treatment. The cast specimens were first homogenized and then hot forged to provide a suitable microstructure prior to the treatment. Cold rolling was carried out with the reductions of 10-95% followed by annealing at temperature of 850 degrees C for 15-1800s. X-ray diffraction, optical and scanning electron microscopy, and tensile and hardness tests were used to characterize the processed specimens.

10.1007/s11661-021-06308-3,Revealing the Effect of Microstructural Inheritance in 1.5 GPa Hot-Rolled Ultrahigh Strength Q&P Steels,"At present, optimization of mechanical properties in quenching and partitioning (Q&P) steels relies primarily on the tailoring of microstructural characteristics by manipulating the alloying elements and the Q&P process. However, adjusting the final microstructure by taking advantage of the inheritance effect derived from the initial microstructure has received less attention. Based on a typical Fe-C-Mn-Si system, the present investigation explores the effect of microstructural inheritance in an ultrahigh strength hot-rolled Q&P steel. The typical hot rolling process is followed by three cooling rates, including quenching, air cooling, and coil cooling, to obtain different initial microstructures of full martensite, bainite-austenite, and ferrite-pearlite, respectively. The same Q&P treatment is then performed to elucidate the inheritance mechanism, and the final Q&P products consist of different fractions of tempered martensite, retained austenite, bainite and fresh martensite. With decreasing cooling rates after hot rolling, the ultimate tensile strengths of the steels after the Q&P treatment are identical at similar to 1.5 GPa, while the total elongations increase gradually from 10.9, 12.7 to 14.5 pct. The highest elongation of the coil-cooled Q&P steel can be attributed to the effect of microstructural inheritance on the Q&P process and retained austenite, leading to larger austenite grain sizes and more equiaxed morphologies. The combination of austenite chemistry and morphology results in the optimal mechanical stability for retained austenite to provide continuous and durable strain hardening. Compared to cold-rolled products, hot-rolled Q&P steel is very attractive to the industry as it can potentially eliminate the cold rolling step and reduce the production cost. Utilizing the microstructural inheritance effect provides a simple and feasible route to control the microstructures and mechanical properties of ultrahigh strength hot-rolled Q&P steel.

Slabs with thicknesses of 30 mm were heated to 1200 °C by a heating furnace for homogenization. The slabs were held at 1200 °C for 2 hours before air cooling to 1050 °C for hot rolling. The homogenized slabs were rolled to 3 mm on a trial hot rolling mill with a roll diameter of 450 mm via 7 passes and a total thickness reduction of 90 pct. The finishing temperature of hot rolling was controlled at 900 °C. Based on thermodynamic calculation results from Thermo-Calc, three different cooling modes after hot rolling were designed to ensure different initial microstructures: (i) Quenching (HR-QC), the hot-rolled plate was quenched to room temperature with water;The samples were put into a 900 °C muffle furnace for 300 seconds (average heating rate of ~ 5 °C/s) before the Q&P process, and the actual austenitizing time was approximately 120 seconds. The fully austenitized steels were cooled to the QT by a salt bath at a cooling rate of 71 °C/s to inhibit ferrite formation. The quenching temperature of 230 °C was determined with the constrained carbon equilibrium (CCE) model using the nominal composition of the steel.

10.1007/s11661-021-06308-3,Revealing the Effect of Microstructural Inheritance in 1.5 GPa Hot-Rolled Ultrahigh Strength Q&P Steels,"At present, optimization of mechanical properties in quenching and partitioning (Q&P) steels relies primarily on the tailoring of microstructural characteristics by manipulating the alloying elements and the Q&P process. However, adjusting the final microstructure by taking advantage of the inheritance effect derived from the initial microstructure has received less attention. Based on a typical Fe-C-Mn-Si system, the present investigation explores the effect of microstructural inheritance in an ultrahigh strength hot-rolled Q&P steel. The typical hot rolling process is followed by three cooling rates, including quenching, air cooling, and coil cooling, to obtain different initial microstructures of full martensite, bainite-austenite, and ferrite-pearlite, respectively. The same Q&P treatment is then performed to elucidate the inheritance mechanism, and the final Q&P products consist of different fractions of tempered martensite, retained austenite, bainite and fresh martensite. With decreasing cooling rates after hot rolling, the ultimate tensile strengths of the steels after the Q&P treatment are identical at similar to 1.5 GPa, while the total elongations increase gradually from 10.9, 12.7 to 14.5 pct. The highest elongation of the coil-cooled Q&P steel can be attributed to the effect of microstructural inheritance on the Q&P process and retained austenite, leading to larger austenite grain sizes and more equiaxed morphologies. The combination of austenite chemistry and morphology results in the optimal mechanical stability for retained austenite to provide continuous and durable strain hardening. Compared to cold-rolled products, hot-rolled Q&P steel is very attractive to the industry as it can potentially eliminate the cold rolling step and reduce the production cost. Utilizing the microstructural inheritance effect provides a simple and feasible route to control the microstructures and mechanical properties of ultrahigh strength hot-rolled Q&P steel.

In order to improve the yield strength of a 304Cu (17%Cr-7%Ni-3%Cu) alloy through substantial grain refinement, a research investigation has been taken up to conduct the reversion annealing treatment comprising a heavy (71%) cold rolling reduction followed by annealing at various temperatures (650-950 degrees C) and durations (1-5400 s). The microstructure evolution was examined by electron backscatter diffraction and further characterized by magnetic measurements, and mechanical properties were determined by tensile and hardness testing. The precipitation of Cu was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. It was found that the reversion of deformation-induced martensite to austenite took place by the shear mechanism, followed by subgrain formation and continuous recrystallization resulting in quite nonuniform grain size distribution. The finest reversed grains were around 0.6 mu m in size, but also much larger austenite grains and a small fraction of unreversed martensite existed in the final structure despite annealing at least up to 800 degrees C. Coherent Cu particles were observed after aging for 1.5 h at 700 and 650 degrees C, while the yield strength could be improved to 507 and 791 MPa, respectively, i.e. by similar to 2-3 times that of the annealed steel.

For reversion treatment, the samples were heated at 200 °C/s to the annealing temperature, held for desired duration and then cooled at the same rate at least down to 300 °C. The initial grain size of the sample was estimated as 31 ± 4 μm. Cold rolling in 13 passes (about 15% each) to the total reduction of 71% resulted in the DIM fraction of 80%, so that still a significant amount of deformed austenite (DA) was retained. The objective of the applied reversion treatment applied was to improve the strength properties of the steel."

The addition of 3 wt.% Ni (3Ni steel) resulted in continuous hardening of the steel during aging heat treatment at 550 degrees C for 100 h whereas the addition of 1.5 wt.% Ni (1.5Ni steel) led to peak hardening at 550 degrees C for 20 h. The size of kappa-carbides after aging heat treatment for 100 h was smaller in 3Ni steel compared with 1.5Ni steel, despite its higher hardness and progressed hardening. Atom probe tomography of the aged 3Ni steel revealed that Al atoms were preferentially enriched in the gamma-matrix with clustering of Ni atoms observed, resulting in the relative depletion of Al in kappa-carbide.

The microstructure was characterized by means of SEM equipped with EPMA, XRD, EBSD and TEM and its effects on tensile strength and ductility were studied. The non-isothermal annealing significantly refined the parent austenite grains and enhanced inhomogeneous distribution of C atoms within the grains. Moreover, a large fraction of M/A constituents were separated and refined to hundreds of nanometers through bainite transformation in TRIP steels, while blocky retained austenite mainly existed near the carbon-rich prior grain boundaries in Q&P steel. TRIP steels had a higher content of less stable retained austenite by isothermal bainite transformation than Q&P steel, thereby favoring for improving the ductility.

The results indicated that the dominant inclusions in Ti-Mg deoxidized steel comprised Ti-Mg-Mn-O center dot MnS, which effectively promoted the nucleation of AF; thus, the microstructure after hot rolling consisted of fine AF and bainite (B). The variety of tensile property of Ti-Mg deoxidized steel was not obvious but the low-temperature impact toughness was significantly improved from 4 J to 126 J at -40 degrees C compared with Al deoxidized steel. Increasing the austenitizing temperature contributed to the nucleation of AF, and large amounts of fine AF formed in Ti-Mg deoxidized steel when the austenitizing temperature was 1250 degrees C with an average austenite grain size of similar to 92 mu m. Two kinds of nucleation mechanisms of AF were elucidated: a Nishiyama-Wasserman (N-W) orientation relationship of (100)(ferrite)parallel to(110)(oxide), [011](ferrite)parallel to[-111](oxide) between AF and Ti-Mg-Mn-O oxide, which caused low lattice disregistry, and a Mn-depleted zone (MDZ) around Ti-Mg-Mn-O center dot MnS inclusions. In order to investigate the reason for the formation of the MDZ, focused ion beam (FIB) was used to prepare the transmission electron microscope (TEM) sample containing a Ti-Mg-Mn-O center dot MnS inclusion, the specific orientation relationship of (-11-1)(MnS)parallel to(11-1)(oxide), [-112](MnS)parallel to[011](oxide) between MnS and the Ti-Mg-Mn-O oxide was examined, and the atomic image of the Ti-Mg-Mn-O oxide was observed.

Experimental results showed the addition of Zr-Ti based deoxidizing agent resulted in the formation of fine Zr-Ti complex oxides. Owing to abundant finely oxides dispersed in the matrix uniformly, the microstructures deoxidized using Zr-Ti was uniform and the strength was enhanced comparing against the steels deoxidized using Al based deoxidizer.

The microstructure changes were characterized by optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The characteristics of carbides precipitated during tempering were analyzed on both carbon extraction replica and thin foil samples by TEM. The mechanical performance was evaluated by Vickers hardness test, tensile test, and Charpy V-notch impact test at ambient temperature. The results of microstructure study indicated that DQT treatment led to a finer microstructure than that of CQT. The carbides of the tempered samples were identified as M7C3. The carbides along the prior austenite grain boundaries nucleated directly while those within the laths should be transformed from cementite which formed at the early tempering stage. Compared with CQT condition, yield strength slightly increased after DQT treatment, and impact toughness improved a lot. The strengthening mechanisms were analyzed and it was found that grain refining and precipitation strengthening were mainly responsible for the increase of strength. The superior toughness of DQT condition was attributed to the finer microstructure resulting in more frequent deflections of the cleavage crack and the smaller size of carbides along the prior austenite boundaries.

The steels used in this study were API X80 pipeline steels (minimum yield strength level; 615 MPa), and their chemical compositions are shown in Table I. An overall grain refinement effect was expected by rolling with a high rolling reduction ratio of 80 pct in the non-recrystallized region of austenite after austenitization at 1453 K (1180 °C) for 2 hours. Rolling was finished at 1155 K (782 °C) in the austenite region above Ar3. After the finish rolling, the steels were rapidly cooled to finish cooling temperature of 785 K (512 °C) at the cooling speed ranging from 15 to 20 K/s, and then were cooled in the air, to room temperature. Specimens were machined in 30 deg to the rolling direction of the steel plates, which are the directions for guarantees of mechanical properties of the UOE and the spiral pipes. For convenience, these four specimens are referred to as ‘A90', ‘A30', ‘B90', and ‘B30' according to the carbon content and the direction."

Microstructure observations revealed that in situ TiC particulates with an average size of 2-10 mu m distributed uniformly in the matrix and the interface boundaries between TiC particulates and austenite matrix were clean without any impurities and contaminations. Addition of TiC particulates refined the grain structure of austenitic matrix, but did not cause formation of any new phases in microstructure. Beneficial effects of TiC addition to austenitic stainless steel on both mechanical properties and oxidation resistance were found. Both at ambient and elevated temperature, tensile strengths of the steel with TiC addition were notably higher than those of its matrix alloy, however, a decrease in ductility also appeared, as exhibited by other particulate reinforced alloys. Besides tensile strengths, creep resistance of austenitic stainless steel was also significantly increased by TiC addition at elevated temperature of 923 K.

Specimens were austenitized at temperatures ranging from 950 to 1200 degrees C for 2 h followed by different cooling methods (furnace, air and water). For analyzing the effect of holding time on mechanical properties, some cast specimens were austenitized at 1100 degrees C for different times followed by furnace cooling. After heat treatment, mechanical tests were employed to evaluate the room temperature Charpy impact and tensile properties. The characterization of complex precipitates formed during heat treatment process was investigated by using analytical electron microscopy. The results show that dissolution of vanadium-containing precipitates plays an important role in the abnormal growth of austenite grains at 1150 degrees C. Further growth in austenite grains at 1200 degrees C is caused by the dissolution of Ti-containing particles and the reduction of the amount of precipitates.

The microstructural variation in the steel has been introduced through ageing at various temperatures after an initial quenching treatment. This has resulted in progressive tempering of the as-quenched martensitic matrix, accompanied by nanoscale precipitation of coherent Cu particles that gradually coarsen and loose coherency with overageing. It was observed that although there was a systematic trend, the FCGR curves were least sensitive to microstructural changes. The variation of fracture toughness, characterized by J(Q) in most cases and by K-Q for the microstructures displaying highest strengths, correlated well with the inverse relationship between fracture toughness and strength. A systematic trend was also observed for the pre-exponent and exponent of the power-law tearing curve (for cases in which brittle fracture was precluded), the blunting-line slope and the SZW.

The study suggested that an average austenite grain size in the ultrafine regime of similar to 2.0 mu m can be obtained using the experimental conditions described in the study, which is similar to 6 times finer than the grain size of commercial 316LN steel. The grain refinement led to high yield strength in ultrafine-grained 316LN steel without any significant compromise in ductility.

10.1016/j.msea.2021.141594,On the structure-property relationship in a novel 1000 MPa hot-rolled TRIP steel with strain-assisted ferrite transformation,"We describe here structure-property relationship in a novel 1000 MPa hot-rolled TRIP steel with strain-assisted ferrite processed by thermo-mechanical controlled processing (TMCP) and tuning of the coiling process. A wide range of experimental material characterization techniques, notably, electron microscopy, EBSD, TEM, and nanoindentation were uniquely combined to understand the structure-property relationship. The ultrafine ferrite (average size of similar to 2.2-3.4 mu m) was obtained by strain-assisted ferrite transformation and carbon was enriched in untransformed austenite, which led to increase in the content of retained austenite. The results indicated that ferrite delayed granular bainite transformation, and a high content of ferrite resulted in high austenite hardenability and facilitated the formation of lath bainite and martensite. The volume fraction of retained austenite was initially increased with the decrease of rolling temperature, followed by a decrease.

The variations of morphology and composition of Cu-rich precipitates as a function of aging time were respectively characterized by electrical resistivity, atom probe tomography (APT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that both hardness and mechanical strength increased to peak value within short aging time, and remained nearly unchanged with prolonged aging time. The TEM observation confirmed a coherent interface between Cu-rich precipitates and austenite matrix, while high number densities of spheroidal Cu-rich precipitates were observed in all aged samples.

Among the different Q-DP process, the sample treated by 250 degrees C Q-DP process exhibits the best combination of strength (1519 MPa), ductility (21.3%), the product of strength and elongation (PSE, 32.4 GPa%) and maximum impact toughness (108 J) compared to the quenching and partitioning (Q&P) process and other Q-DP processes. In addition, the work hardening behaviors of the Q&P and Q-DP samples were investigated. The stress-strain curves show that the Q&P and 250 degrees C Q-DP treated samples exhibit the larger uniform elongation and the value of n calculated for samples is 0.109 and 0.101 respectively.

The APT analysis confirmed that the composition of Cu-rich precipitate was enriched in Cu atoms and depleted of other elements with increasing aging temperature, while their core composition became nearly pure Cu at high aging temperatures. In addition, due to strong bonding energy, Ni was significantly segregated at the gamma-Fe matrix/precipitate heterophase interface, with Gibbsian interfacial excesses related to Fe and Cu of 0.6036 +/- 0.52, 2.892 +/- 0.55 and 2.908 +/- 0.38 atoms nm(-2) after aging at 600, 700 and 800 degrees C, respectively.

10.1016/j.msea.2017.03.064,Microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of duplex TRIP steel produced by strip casting,"In the present study, a duplex TRIP steel (Fe-0.232C-2.0Si-2.39Mn-2.01Al wt%) was successfully produced by a novel processing route involving twin-roll strip casting (TRSC), heat treatment, cold rolling and annealing for the first time. The evolution of microstructure during the entire processing route was extensively studied that included determination of mechanical properties and fractography of tensile specimens of annealed sheets. It was observed that the as-cast strip microstructure consisted of ferrite and martensite. The morphology at the surface and the center was dendritic and equiaxed, respectively. On using an appropriate heat treatment schedule (heat treatment at 780 degrees C for 10 min followed by direct quenching), a duplex structure of ferrite and retained austenite (RA) in the heat-treated strip was obtained that was suitable for cold rolling. Annealing temperature was very critical for microstructure and mechanical properties of the annealed sheets. Annealing at 780 degrees C for 5 min followed by direct quenching, yielded a duplex structure of ferrite and RA (volume fraction of similar to 22%), which exhibited an excellent combination of tensile strength and total elongation of 945 MPa and 28.56%, respectively.",Mechanical properties of A75-A80 steels.,A80,Tensile strength (MPa),996,MPa,Yield strength (MPa),515,MPa,Total elongation (%),8.89,%,0,0,0.232,0,0,0,0,0,2.01,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Thus, 2wt% Al was added in the experimental steel, which is different from the composition of traditional TRIP steel. Liquid steel was melted in a vacuum induction furnace of capacity ~50kg. The liquid steel was poured into a pre-heated tundish (1200°C) and then allowed to flow into the cast rollers using a hole-type nozzle. Lastly, the as-cast strip was cooled to room temperature by water after strip casting. The thickness of the as-cast strip was measured to be ~2.2mm. The as-cast strip was cut into small samples for subsequent processing. The as-cast strip samples were heated to 700-800°C for 10min, followed by water quenching. For convenience, the as-cast strip samples heat treated at 780 °C are referred as H78. Next, H78 steels were cold rolled to 0.8mm (64% reduction).

10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.11.046,Interplay between reversed austenite and plastic deformation in a directly quenched and intercritically annealed 0.04C-5Mn low-Al steel,"We have elucidated here the interplay between reversed austenite and plastic deformation in a directly quenched and intercritically annealed medium-manganese low-Al steel in terms of microstructural evolution and mechanical properties. The ultra-low carbon 5Mn steel was subjected to controlled rolling and direct quenching, followed by intercritical annealing at 630 degrees C and 650 degrees C for 30 min, respectively. The directly quenched steel consisted of thin lath-martensite of similar to 0.2-0.9 mm thickness and similar to 1.7-2.0% retained austenite with similar to 50 nm thickness. Intercritical annealing led to a microstructure consisting of alternate sub-micron laminated structure of tempered martensite and reversed austenite. With increase in annealing temperature from 630 degrees C to 650 degrees C, the volume fraction of austenite was increased from 12.6% to 19.1% at 1/4 thickness (t/4), and from 8.4% to 12.7% at 1/2 thickness (t/2). The yield strength, tensile strength, and elongation of 728 MPa, 826 MPa, and 25.5%, were obtained at t/4 of the plate, and 714 MPa, 814 MPa, and 24.2% at t/2, on annealing at 630 degrees C. The impact energy obtained at similar to 60 degrees C was greater than 80 J. When the annealing temperature was increased to 650 degrees C, strength was marginally decreased, but toughness was significantly increased to more than 110 J. Extremely small variation in microstructure and mechanical properties at t/4 and t/2 plate thickness were observed. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed similar to 7.2-10.1 wt% Mn enrichment in reversed austenite during annealing, which is of significance in stabilization of reversed austenite. Work hardening behavior and tensile experiments were conducted to study the effect of reversed austenite during plastic deformation. With increased annealing temperature, the stability of reversed austenite was decreased because of less enrichment of C and Mn in reversed austenite and grain growth. At 0.05 tensile strain, reversed austenite transformed to twin-type martensite, implying occurrence of transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

All the properties were enhanced in the Nbor (Nb + Mo)-alloyed steels, especially in the (Nb + Mo)-alloyed steel. The Nb alloying worked for the precipitation of nano-sized complex carbides, thereby leading to the refinement of prior austenite grains by a Zener pinning effect. Mo also contributed to the grain refinement, while Mo affected it mostly in a solid-solution state by a solute drag effect. This grain refinement resulted in the more deviated crack propagation path and consequently in the more improved Charpy impact energy. The size reduction of Ti(C,N) inclusion due to the attachment of a small amount of Nb and Mo also improved the impact toughness. As well as microstructural effects, the lower residual stress due to the lower peak bending load by the Nb or (Nb + Mo) alloying contributed to the increase in H-induced delayed cracking time.

Two-step annealed samples have bimodal microstructures, which are reversely transformed from partially recrystallized thermal martensite into lath-and globular-shaped grains of austenite (gamma)-ferrite (alpha).

A Fe-based high-strength steel was developed by the trace-element regional supply method during deoxidization to generate in situ nanoparticles with a high number density in the matrix. The results show that the endogenous nanoparticles are aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and titanium oxide (Ti3O5) formed in the liquid melt. Al2O3 functioned as a heterogeneous nucleation site for MnS during solidification; the size of the resultant complex inclusions was approximately 1-2 mu m. Furthermore. 13 nm Nb(C,N) precipitates grew with the Ti3O5 during the tempering process. These in situ nanoparticles strongly affected refining of the grain and inclusions. The investigated steel was strengthened more than 200 MPa by precipitation strengthening and more than 265 MPa by grain refinement strengthening according to the Ashby-Orowan mechanism and the Hall-Petch relationship, respectively.

The as-cast strip was subjected to two different processing routes. The microstructure of the as-cast strip, cold-rolled sheet and annealed sheet was studied and related to mechanical properties of the annealed sheet. It was observed that the as-cast strip microstructure consisted of grain boundary ferrite, Widmanstatten ferrite, pearlite and intragranular ferrite, and the solidification structure was characterized by dendritic structure without the equiaxed center zone.

The average size of particles in the Zr-containing steel is found to be the same as the Zr-free steel (0.49 mu m). However, the number of smaller particles in the Zr-containing steel is much higher than the Zr-free steel. The inclusions in the Zr-containing steel are composed of ZrO2-TiN-MnS, and inclusions in the Zr-free steel are consisted of TiOx-Ti(C,N). The average prior austenite grain size of the Zr-containing steel is consistently smaller than that of the Zr-free steel, due to a large number of fine oxide inclusions and Ti(C,N) precipitates, working to pin the austenite grain boundaries at temperatures up to 1673 K (1400 degrees C).

Three different tensile strain rates of 5x10(-4), 5x10(-3), and 5x10(-2)s(-1) were selected in the tensile test. The deformation microstructures and fracture morphologies of the two steels after fracture in the tensile test were observed to analyze the tensile deformation response to different tensile strain rates. Results showed that the grain size of Mn12CrN steel was evidently refined after alloying with N+Cr. The grain would not become abnormally coarse even with increasing austenitizing temperature. During tensile deformation, the strength and plasticity of Mn12CrN steel were superior to those of Mn12 steel at the same strain rate. With increasing the strain rate, the changes in strength and plasticity of Mn12CrN steel were less sensitive to tensile strain rate compared with Mn12 steel. The effects of grain refinement and N+Cr alloying on dynamic strain aging and deformation twining behaviors were responsible for this lack of sensitivity to strain rate.",Tensile properties of Mn12CrN steel and Mn12 steel at different strain rates.,Mn12,Tensile strength/MPa,913,MPa,Yield strength/MPa,387,MPa,Elongation/%,44.3,%,0,0,1.14,0.016,0,0,0,0,0.027,0.42,0.001,0.005,0,0,0,0,0.07,11.7,0,0,0,0.009,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The steels used in this study were traditional Hadfield steel Mn12 and N+Cr alloyed Hadfield steel Mn12CrN, and the chemical compositions are listed in Table 1.

The micro-alloying elements such as Nb and Mo have been known to improve the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement by refining grains and providing interfaces of precipitates. Ti is also utilized for the mentioned purposes; however, the effect of Ti on hydrogen embrittlement, particularly in (Nb + Mo) multi-alloyed system, has not been revealed clearly yet. In this study, therefore, the alloying effects of Ti on resistance to hydrogen embrittlement were investigated via controlling Ti content and conducting slow-strain-rate tensile (SSRT) tests and thermal desorption analyses (TDA) after the hydrogen charging. The complex addition of Nb, Mo, and Ti promotes the formation of nanoscale (Nb,Ti)C and (Nb,Mo,Ti)C complex precipitates along with coarse Ti(C,N) particles. The increased Ti content to 0.03 wt% increases the volume fraction of nanoscale precipitates, which effectively refines the prior austenite grain size and interfacial incoherency, thereby providing stable hydrogen trapping sites with the higher activation energy for hydrogen desorption.

The results indicated that deformation-induced martensite transformation was the dominant deformation mechanism during cold rolling, and a mixed microstructure consisting of similar to 60% volume fraction of alpha'-martensite and deformed austenite was obtained. Deformation twinning of austenite dominated the deformation during warm rolling. The underlying reason was the increasing SFE with deformation temperature, which inhibited the martensitic transformation but promoted the formation of deformation twins. On annealing, the recrystallization of retained austenite in cold-rolled samples was retarded because of martensitic reversion compared to the warm-rolled samples. Completely recrystallized structure with average grain size of similar to 0.7 mu m was obtained in both cold and warm-rolled samples after annealing at 800 degrees C.

The coated steel substrates were austenitized at 920 degrees C for several dwells, and phase formation at the steel/coating interface was investigated by means of ex-situ phase analysis with synchrotron radiation and EBSD. Phase identification by EBSD and XRD confirmed the formation of Al-rich intermetallics during austenitization. Increasing the dwell time led to Fe diffusion into the Al-base coating as well as Al diffusion into the substrate. As a result of the diffusion processes, Al-rich intermetallics in the coating transformed to more Fe-rich intermetallics. Simultaneously, Al diffusion into the substrate changed the microstructure of the steel substrate near the coating interface.

Optimization of the alloying elements was done based on thermodynamic and kinetic calculations. Emphasis was given to obtain ultrafine bainitic microstructure by maximizing the driving force and lowering the transformation temperature of bainite formation. In addition to bainite, the microstructure contained a small amount of austenite and martensite. It was observed that Mn decreases G to a greater extent as compared to Cr and Si. Therefore, a low Mn-high Cr alloy exhibited large driving force and low B-s temperature. Si promoted carbon partitioning in the adjacent austenite to make it more stable. Therefore, the transformation of deformation-induced martensite from the retained austenite during the deformation process was restricted, resulting in higher toughness of the alloy.

10.1016/j.msea.2019.01.025,"The effect of increasing Cu and Ni on a significant enhancement of mechanical properties of high strength low alloy, low carbon steels of HSLA-100 type","High strength low alloy steels (HSLAs) containing copper, nickel and low amount of Carbon are a new generation of high strength low alloy steels that are widely used in shipbuilding. Strengthening elements such as Cu, Ni, and to some extend C, play a significant role in this family of steels. By increasing the amount of Cu, Ni, and by selection of proper final temperature of rolling, austenitization and aging, it is possible to enhance the yield strength of this steel up to 160 ksi (1102 MPa) while at the same time toughness remains at an acceptable level. In this investigation, the effect of increasing Cu and Ni on mechanical properties of these steels was elaborated. Four steels with varying amounts of Cu and Ni were cast, and hot rolled by a thermomechanical controlled processing. The steels were then austenitized at 920 degrees C for 45 min followed by quenching in water. Finally, the steels were aged at 650 degrees C for one hour. Optical microscope, and Filed Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) were used to study microstructural evolution. Mechanical properties variation was evaluated by tensile and microhardness tests. Results showed that by increasing the amount of these two elements, hardness and tensile strength were increased in thermomechanically controlled processed, austenitized and aged specimens. Yield strength values of the rolled samples were somehow scattered which was due to a slight difference in final rolling temperature and the subsequent rapid cooling. Yield strength under austenitization and quenching conditions increased by increasing the amount of Cu and Ni which could be due to the presence of Nb (C, N) precipitates. Increasing the amount. of Cu precipitates after quench could also be another reason for yield strength increment. Increasing the amount of Cu and Ni in samples containing 4.16 and 7.65 wt% for each of these alloys led to the reduction of A(c1) (austenite formation temperature). Selecting aging temperature (650 degrees C) higher than the austenite formation temperature could probably lead to the growth of the carbides, softening of martensite layers and lower amount of dislocations density hence for the reduction of yield strength of the aged steels. As well, with the addition of the mentioned amounts of Cu and Ni, yield strength of 705 MPa (102.2 ksi), tensile strength of 1072 MPa (155.4 ksi), elongation of 14% and area reduction of 63% were obtained in the aged steels of this investigation.",Tensile test results for the four steels after aging at 650 degC for one hour and air cooling.,A42,Tensile Strength (MPa),1072,MPa,Yield Strength (MPa),705,MPa,Elongation (%),14.34,%,0,0,0.052,0,0,0,0,0,0.064,0.21,0.012,0.005,0,0,0.014,0.026,0.69,1,0,0,7.65,4.16,0,0,0,0,0.04,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"To investigate the effect of Cu and Ni elements on increasing the strength/toughness of high Ni HSLA steels, four chemical compositions with different weight percent of Cu and Ni (Ni to Cu ratio of about 2) were selected based on chemical composition of HSLA-100 (standard MIL-S-24645). Samples were numbered from A1 to A4 based on the gradual increment of Cu and Ni content. The four chemical compositions were melted in a 10 kg inductoterm induction furnace with the frequency of 75 kw. The ingots were then uniformed and pre-heated in an electric furnace held at 1200 °C with the precision of ± 10 °C.

10.1016/j.msea.2015.02.067,Development of high strength hot rolled low carbon copper-bearing steel containing nanometer sized carbides,"A low carbon ferritic steel was alloyed with Ti, Mo and Cu with the intention of achieving greater increment in strength by multiple precipitate strengthening. The steel is hot rolled and subjected to interrupted cooling to enable precipitation of Ti-Mo carbides and copper. Thermodynamic calculations were carried out to determine equilibrium phase fractions at different temperatures. Microstructure characterization using transmission electron microscopy and composition analysis revealed that the steel contains similar to 5 nm size precipitates of (Ti,Mo)C. Precipitation kinetics calculations using MatCalc software showed that mainly body centered cubic copper precipitates of size < 5nm form under the cooling conditions in the present study. The steel has the high tensile strength of 853 MPa and good ductility. The yield strength increases by 420 MPa, which is more than that achieved in hot rolled low carbon ferritic steels with only copper precipitates or only carbide precipitates. The precipitation and strengthening contribution of copper and (Ti,Mo)C precipitates and their effect on the work hardening behavior is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile, the mass% of the fine particles (< 10 nm in size) of Nb-Mo steel was 58.4%, and higher than that of Nb-Ti steel with 30.0%. Therefore, the results of strengthening mechanisms analysis showed the higher strength of Nb-Mo steel than that of Nb-Ti steel is attributed to its relatively more prominent precipitation strengthening effect. The yield strength increments from precipitation hardening of Nb-Mo steel attained 182.7 MPa and higher than that of Nb-Ti steel.",Table 2 Mechanical properties of different materials,Nb–Mo,TS (Mpa),640,Mpa,YS (MPa),600,MPa,EL,23.5,no mentioned,0,0,0.027,0.003,0,0,0,0,0.005,0.2,0.0092,0.007,0,0,0,0,0,1.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.081,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"These steels were melted in a vacuum induction furnace and cast into the ingots.

The material damage is represented by the effective elastic modulus (E) over tilde, and the relations of indentation load P and effective elastic modulus (E) over tilde with the plastic indentation depth h(p) are extracted from its given experimental indentation P-h curves. The critical damage value D' can be determined by the critical void volume fraction f', then critical effective elastic modulus (E) over tilde (+) corresponding to D+ can be obtained. The curves of logarithmic effective elastic modulus In (E) over tilde and logarithmic plastic indentation depth In h(p) show approximate linear relationship. Thus the values of In h(p)(+) corresponding to In (E) over tilde are determined. And the strain energy density factor S is calculated according to the equations of indentation load P. plastic indentation depth h(p) and effective elastic modulus (E) over tilde. Finally, the values of fracture toughness K-IC of 0Cr12Mn5Ni4Mo3Al steel used in the present work are calculated based on the predicted critical value of strain energy density factor S-c by indentation tests.

10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2014.06.002,The effect of quenching and defects size on the HCF behaviour of Boron steel,"This work investigates the effect of natural and artificial surface defects and quenching on the fatigue strength of a Boron steel (22MnB5). A vast experimental campaign has been undertaken to study the high cycle fatigue behaviour and more specifically the fatigue damage mechanisms observed in quenched and untreated materials, under different loading conditions and with differents artificial defects sizes (from 25 mu m to 370 mu m radius). In order to test the sheet metal in shear an original test apparatus is used. The critical defect size is determined to be 100 +/- 50 mu m. This critical size does not appear to depend on the loading type or the microstructure of the material (i.e. ferritic-perlitic or martensitic). However, for large defects, the quenched material is more sensitive to the defect size than the untreated material. Fora defect size range of 100-300 mu m the slope of the Kitagawa-Takahashi diagram is approximately -1/3 and -1/6 for the quenched and untreated materials respectively. A probabilistic approach that leads naturally to a probabilistic Kitagawa type diagram is developed. This methodology can be used to explain the relationship between the influence of the heat treatment and the defect size on the fatigue behaviour of this steel. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

An atomic-scale structural analysis by high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) also was carried out. The (Cu, Mn) S precipitates manifested a core-shell structure, the shell part containing Cu and S elements, and the core part Mn and S elements. Most of the nano-scale nitrides of wurtzite structure were less than 30 nm in diameter; indeed, the average diameter as estimated was about 20 nm.

10.1007/s11665-014-1190-6,Effect of Partial Replacement of Si with Al on the Microstructures and Mechanical Properties of 1000 MPa TRIP Steels,"Two newly synthesized C-Mn-Si-Mo-Nb transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steels with and without Al addition were designed in order to achieve significant improvements in the mechanical properties. The effect of substitution of Si by Al on tensile properties and the microstructure of cold-rolled C-Mn-Si TRIP steel was investigated under different heat treatments. It was shown that a complex ultrafine microstructure composed of different phases was formed and two types of morphology for ferrite were detected (equiaxial and polygonal). The distribution of alloying elements was observed by using electron probe microanalysis. It was clear that C was concentrated in the retained austenite (RA) and small M/A (austenite/martensite) islands. The Al addition facilitated the formation of polygonal ferrite and increased the stability of the RA. The strain-hardening behavior was studied in detail. All the investigated specimens showed a very high strain-hardening exponent (instantaneous n) but their strain dependence was different. For the C-Mn-Si-Mo-Nb TRIP steel, the maximum n value was achieved when the strain was only about 0.04, while the n value of the Al substituted TRIP steel increased gradually until strains in the range of 0.07-0.10 were reached and the maximum value was achieved. As a result, the elongations of the steel with Al addition increased considerably without obvious deterioration of strength. It was the first time to find microtwinned martensite located between ferrite and bainitic ferrite after tensile deformation in the low alloy TRIP steel with Al.","Table 2 Mechanical properties, volume fractions, and carbon contents of the retained austenite of investigated steels",B-723 K (450 °C),"Tensile strength σb, MPa",998,MPa,"Yield strength σ0.2, MPa",420,MPa,"Total elongation δ, %",27.2,%,0,0,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0.94,0.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.058,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"In this study, the experimental steels were vacuum-melted and cast into ingots with weight of 40 kg.

The quenched steels were reheated to 820 °C for 30 min with water quenching (RQ process) and the equiaxed prior austenite grain was obtained. The heating rate was 200 °C/h, cooling rate was 16 °C/s, and the specimens were preserved at 850 °C for 15 min.

10.1016/j.msea.2021.141813,Effect of Nb microalloying on microstructure evolution and mechanical properties in low carbon medium manganese steel,"The effect of Nb microalloying on microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of 0.02C-7Mn steel was investigated. The results showed that the microstructure was fully quenched martensite after subjected to reheating and quenching (RQ) process. The microstructure consisted of tempered mmartensite, reversed austenite (RA), and athermal E-mattensite after tempered at 620 degrees C, while the microstructure contained tempered mmartensite, RA, athermal E-martensite, and athermal mmartensite after tempered at 650 degrees C. The thermal and mechanical stability of both RA and athermal E-mattensite decreased after the 0.05% Nb was added to the 0.02C-7Mn steel, and also decreased as the intercritical tempering (IT) temperature increased, which was mainly because the content of solid solution C in RA decreased. The calculated stacking fault energies (SFEs) were all negative, which spontaneously induced athermal martensitic transformation. Multiphase microstructure resulted in the remarkable mechanical property evolution. After tempered at 620 degrees C, the optical mechanical properties of 7Mn-0.05Nb steel were obtained: yield strength of 720.0 MPa, tensile strength of 819.0 MPa, total elongation of 26.0% and -40 degrees C impact energy of 266 J, while the yield strength of 675.0 MPa, tensile strength of 776.5 MPa, the total elongation of 29.5% and the -40 degrees C impact energy of 274 J appeared in 7Mn-ONb steel. As the IT temperature increased to 650 degrees C, the yield strength of both the steels sharply decreased (475.5 MPa for 650 degrees C-ONb steel and 460.5 MPa for 650 degrees C-0.05Nb steel), and the tensile strength of both the steels increased about 56 MPa, while the -40 degrees C impact energy decreased by 40 and 60 J, respectively, showing that the -40 degrees C impact energy was not very sensitive to the mechanical stability of RA and athermal E-martensite. The mean size of NbC particles was mainly about 5-7 nm, which significantly improved the precipitation strengthening, but there was just little damage to low-temperature toughness.",Room temperature tensile properties of experimental steels.,650-0.05Nb,Tensile Strength/MPa,875.5,MPa,Yield Strength/MPa,460.5,MPa,Total Elongation/%,21,%,0,0,0.02,0.0024,0,0,0,0,0,0.097,0,0,0,0,0.0052,0,0,6.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.046,0.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The steels were melted by means of a 100 kg high-frequency vacuum induction furnace and cast into ingots, following the forging process into a 90 × 200 × 120 mm3 billet between 950 and 1100 °C.

The microstructure observation showed that lath-type austenite existed in the martensitic matrix, blocky and granular austenite occurred at the boundaries of primary austenite/preexisting ferrite or martensite/preexisting ferrite after two-step annealing. Based on the numerical simulations of the second annealing process, the preexisting austenite further grew rapidly without nucleation, while some secondary austenite nucleated at the martensitic lath boundaries and then grew into martensite at a relatively sluggish rate.

Grain refinement induced by warm deforming and reversal austenization was studied by thermal simulation experiments, and its effect on properties was assessed by thin-plate hot rolling experiments. The study suggested that austenite was refined to similar to 10 mu m after reversal austenization, which was further refined to similar to 5 mu m after reversal austenization and application of warm deforming. Warm deforming recrystallized the microstructure during the reheating process, when the reheating rate was less than 2 degrees C/s. While recrystallization was inhibited at reheating rates greater than 5 degrees C/s. The ultimate microstructure obtained from the refined austenite via combination of warm deforming and reversal austenization, comprised of fine-grained (4.7 +/- 3.2 mu m) ferrite and pearlite with small colony size (1.3 +/- 0.6 mu m). On the other hand, the fine-grained microstructure was characterized by reduced extent of coarse precipitation (9.3 +/- 3.4 nm), compared to the coarse-grained thermo-mechanical controlled processing (TMCP) plate with dispersed and fine precipitation (4.0 +/- 13 nm), which was responsible for lower strength (similar to 70 MPa) of the fine-grained plate than the coarse-grained TMCP plate.

Two low-alloy martensitic steels with and without Al alloying were both prepared. Layered structure with white band and black matrix was observed in Al alloyed steel, while a homogeneous microstructure was displayed in the steel without Al. Both steels achieved high strength (tensile strength over 1600 MPa) and good ductility (elongation over 11 pct), but they displayed stark contrasts on impact fracture mode and Charpy impact energy. Delamination fracture occurred in Al alloyed steel and the impact energies were significantly increased both at room temperature (from 75 to 138 J, i.e., nearly improved up to 2 times) and low temperatures [from 47.9 to 71.3 J at 233 K (-40 A degrees C)] compared with the one without Al. Alloying with Al promotes the segregation of Cr, Mn, Si and C elements to form a network structure, which is martensite with higher carbon content and higher hardness than that of the matrix. And this network structure evolved into a band structure during the hot rolling process. The difference of yield stress between the band structure and the matrix gives rise to a delamination fracture during the impact test, which increases the toughness greatly.",Table III Mechanical Properties of Steels With and Without Al Alloying,Without Al,"('TS (MPa)', 'TS (MPa)')",1687,MPa,"('YS (MPa)', 'YS (MPa)')",1354,MPa,"('Elongation (Pct)', 'Elongation (Pct)')",12.9,no mentioned,0,0,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0.49,1.2,0.035,0.035,0,0,0,0.1,0.98,1.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The experimental steel with 0.5 wt pct Al was melted in vacuum induction furnace and 10 kg ingot was casted with a diameter of 100 mm.

Layered structure with white band and black matrix was observed in Al alloyed steel, while a homogeneous microstructure was displayed in the steel without Al. Both steels achieved high strength (tensile strength over 1600 MPa) and good ductility (elongation over 11 pct), but they displayed stark contrasts on impact fracture mode and Charpy impact energy. Delamination fracture occurred in Al alloyed steel and the impact energies were significantly increased both at room temperature (from 75 to 138 J, i.e., nearly improved up to 2 times) and low temperatures [from 47.9 to 71.3 J at 233 K (-40 A degrees C)] compared with the one without Al. Alloying with Al promotes the segregation of Cr, Mn, Si and C elements to form a network structure, which is martensite with higher carbon content and higher hardness than that of the matrix. And this network structure evolved into a band structure during the hot rolling process. The difference of yield stress between the band structure and the matrix gives rise to a delamination fracture during the impact test, which increases the toughness greatly.",Table III Mechanical Properties of Steels With and Without Al Alloying,With Al,"('TS (MPa)', 'TS (MPa)')",1636,MPa,"('YS (MPa)', 'YS (MPa)')",1341,MPa,"('Elongation (Pct)', 'Elongation (Pct)')",11.7,no mentioned,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.18,0.035,0.035,0,0,0,0.09,1.02,1.21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The experimental steel with 0.5 wt pct Al was melted in vacuum induction furnace and 10 kg ingot was casted with a diameter of 100 mm.

The ingots were heated to 1473 K (1200 °C) for 2 hours. After air-cooling to 1273 K (1000 °C), the ingots were forged and rolled to plates with section area of 50 × 20 mm2. And the bars were directly quenched to room temperature after rolling at ending temperature of 1193 K (920 °C) and were tempered at 473 K (200 °C) for 2 hours. The dog-bone-shaped tensile specimens with a gauge length of 65 mm, width of 12.5 mm and thickness of 10 mm were machined from the bars in parallel to the rolling (RD) direction.

10.1016/j.matchar.2019.04.004,Effect of Ti variation on microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of low carbon medium Mn heavy plate steel,"Controlled rolling and direct quenching followed by intercritical annealing was adopted to process Ti micro-alloyed low-C medium Mn heavy steel plates. Furthermore, the effect of Ti content on the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties was elucidated. The submicro-laminar microstructure of reverted austenite and lath-shaped ferrite was obtained after intercritical annealing at 630 degrees C. Increase in Ti content from 0.014% to 0.032% increased the amount of nano-scale TiC precipitates, leading to refinement of both the prior austenite grains and the subsequent laminar structure.

The hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility was evaluated by means of slow strain rate test (SSRT), thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS), and fractographic analysis on cathodically charged 0Cr16Ni5Mo and 40CrNiMoA steels. The X-ray diffraction results showed that there is no hydride formed on the surface of Cr-Ni-Mo steels after cathodic hydrogen charging. Reduction of area dramatically deteriorated from 74% to 4% by introducing 9.5 wppm hydrogen for 0Cr16Ni5Mo steel, while the variations of plasticity for 40CrNiMoA steel were slight after hydrogen charging. Meanwhile, the TDS results indicated that the activation energies for low temperature peaks were fairly similar, corresponding to the same trapping sites in both experimental steels, while some irreversible trapping sites existed in 40CrNiMoA steel. Moreover, upon increasing the hydrogen concentration, the fracture feature transferred from ductile to a mixed morphology of dimples, quasi-cleavage and intergranular features for 0Cr16Ni5Mo steel, but only just ductile fracture for 40CrNiMoA steel due to low hydrogen concentration.
