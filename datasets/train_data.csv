An EOS M290 system was used to build the ɸ12 × 120 mm Corrax steel cylinders on top of 420 under an Argon atmosphere using the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technique. The laser power, scanning speed, hatching distance and layer thickness were 258.7 W, 1066.7 mm/s, 100 µm, and 30 µm, respectively. The laser beam was rotated 67° between successive layers during the process. The platform temperature was kept at 80 °C during the printing process to reduce the residual stresses at the interface. The commercial heat treatment of 420 steel includes austenitization at 1010–1030 °C followed by tempering at 230–300 °C, while the heat treatment of Corrax includes austenitization at approximately 900 °C followed by aging at 500–550 °C. In this work, we examined combinations of austenitization and aging temperatures and concluded that a hybrid heat treatment cycle in an Argon atmosphere optimizes mechanical properties and compatibility between 420 and Corrax steels. We chose the 420 austenitization temperature and the Corrax aging temperature as described in the following. The hybrid steel was heated at 15 °C/min to the maximum temperature of 1010 °C and then held for 30 min, followed by quenching with high-pressure Argon, to obtain a fully martensitic matrix.

In the first stage, heating was continued up to 710 °C (983.15 °K) at a heating rate of 5 deg/s. In the second stage, the slower heating rate of 1 deg/s was employed to reach 790 °C (1063.15 °K). In the third stage, heating to 840 °C (1113.15 °K) was conducted at a heating rate of 2 deg/s. Finally, the cooling route similar to that of CAL process was followed. The metallurgical attributes by which the resultant DP microstructure was obtained in CHCL are discussed elsewhere. The objective of CAS process was to obtain core- and shell-like DP microstructure having martensite packets surrounded by three-dimensional ferrite network/channel. The underlying phenomenon of the evolution of such microstructure for CAS process, as shown in Figure 1, is reported elsewhere."

After the casting in the vacuum atmosphere the ingot was directly cooled into water, and then the steel was forged into an 80mm thick slab. The chemical composition of the steel is listed in Table 1 . The measured Ac1 and Ac3 temperatures for the present steel were 712 and 810°C respectively. After forging, the steel was reheated to 1200°C and held for 2h, and then it was rolled to 10mm thick plate. The plates were then cooled in air to 800°C from the finish rolling temperature (relaxation process) and followed by the accelerated cooling to 400°C, and then cooled to room temperature in air.
